- report covers system functionality and high-level design, discussion of the
  ASTSIM-LCS and Jaccard similarity approaches, some experimental results,
  and lessons learned from the course
- the report contains an interesting discussion explaining the reason for
  moving away from a DFS-based approach and using a visitor-based approach
  instead
- good discussion about the disadvantages of the Jaccard approach
  (its susceptibility to differences in variable and method names) and
  the reasons for still preserving it in the system
- also, good discussion of the ASTSIM-LCS approach. Since this is a more
  involved algorithm, it would have been preferable to present the
  algorithm in a more structured way, e.g. using pseudo-code
- it is good that references are cited for the algorithms that you use,
  but such references should include the name of the conference/journal
  where the work was published, and the year of publication
- overall, excellent job
